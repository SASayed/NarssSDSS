overall suitability of a given area or a farm,With higher frequency of dry periods, efficient land utilisation for agricultural&#13;
production systems is required for the survival of most farms in El Alamein. Therefore land evaluation&#13;
techniques and their resulting soil or land suitability maps must address the economic viability and provide&#13;
information for management decisions at field or farm scale. Modern precision agricultural practices require&#13;
across-farm and/or within-field soil variability which should be accounted for in the suitability assessment&#13;
for it to be an effective tool for management decisions. Soil function under a number of land uses should also&#13;
be assessed as it provides different options to the farmer and thus reduces the farmer√¢&#128;&#153;s dependency on a&#13;
single land use.</description><status>New</status><model>New_Model_20170330111127</model><mcda>mcda_20174169421</mcda></casestudy><casestudy><id>Water_Pollution _20170507114344</id><name>Water_Pollution </name><description>Water Pollution Case Study</description><status>New</status><model>New_Model_20170330111127</model><mcda>mcda_201757135051</mcda></casestudy></casestudies>
